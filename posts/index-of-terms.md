## HTTP Cookie

A small piece of state data (< 4093 bytes) that a server can set; the data is then returned by the browser on each subsequent request to the server domain (until the cookie expires). A cookie is set with the `set-cookie` response header. The cookie value is returned to the server via the `cookie` request header.
